# Team_Profile_Generator
This applications collects information information about team members using the imported inquirer module. This data is stored in the instances of the team member classes. A webpage is created from these objects where each team member details are displayed as a card. A sample page is shown below:

## Testing
The team class structures are testing during development to ensure that the object instances can hold the require data and the methods function as specified. The test setup harness was created using the jest module.The image below shows that all four classes were successfully tested prior to use.

## Application Use
The team page can be generated within the visual code once the environment is setup with all the required modules such as node, jest,inquirer,etc. Open the index.js file in an integrated terminal and run the command 'node index.js'. This will bring up the dialogue used for entering team data. Once the team data is entered the html page is automatically generated and saved in the output folder. This can be viewed in a browser in all its glory.
